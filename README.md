# Airtable Script Mono-Repo

The purpose of this repo is to archive some of my early work writing scripts in the [Airtable](https://airtable.com) platform. I developed a deep understanding of JavaScript by using Airtable as a sort of playground, and these are some of the more complete artifacts from that period. A brief description of each script is provided below.

These scripts are highly specific to my base structure and data-crunching needs, thus probably not useful for anyone else. Many of them were abandoned after serving the bare-minimum purpose for which they were written, or in some cases after performing 'well enough' to make manual edge-case handling easier. I have long since outgrown the ecosystem and moved on to more advanced software development techniques.

### BalanceAccounts.js
The goal of this script was to match transactional data exported from a 3rd-party budgeting app with data from financial institution records. It was designed to make a 'best-effort' pass, matching as many transactions as possible without error so that un-matched records could be handled manually.
