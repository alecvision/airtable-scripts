# Airtable Script Mono-Repo

The purpose of this repo is to archive some of my early work writing scripts in the [Airtable](https://airtable.com) platform. They are highly specific to my base structure and data-crunching needs, thus probably not useful for anyone else.

Many of them were abandoned after serving the bare-minimum purpose for which they were written, or in some cases after performing 'well enough' to make manual edge-case handling easier.
